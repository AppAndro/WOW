#Tools used

2. Visual Studio (To Build The API)
3. I Have Used Code From My Own Apps. I have parts of the code from them 7 changed them to fit the needs
4. I Have Used Answers by fabric(App Analytics) & Crashlytics (Crash Logging Library)
5. I Used Digits By Fabric To Build OTP Authentication System./
